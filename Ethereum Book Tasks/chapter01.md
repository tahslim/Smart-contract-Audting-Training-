# Ethereum Book Chapter 01 
## What is Ethereum
This topic gives an overview of Ethereum, describing it as "the world computer", it further decribes it as a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine which consists of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.
Ethereum is also an open source, globally decentralized computing infastructure that executes smart contracts while synchronising and storing the systems state changes, ether is cryptocurrency wsed on the Ethereum network to meter and constrain costs of execution.
The Ethereum network enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.

## Compared to Bitcoin
Bitcoin being the front runner of cryptocurrencies is usually confused with Ethereum, however they are totally different in networks for example, Ethereums purpose is not primarily to be a digital currency payment network, ether is used as a utility currency to pay for the use of the platform as the world computer.
Ethereum is also designed to be a general-purpose programmable blockchain that runs a virtual machine capable of executing code, Where Bitcoin's script is intentionally constrained to true/false evaluation of spending conditions.

## Components of a Blockchain 
This topic give insight into several components components of blockchainc, which include:
 >peer-to-peer (P2P) network connecting participants and propagating transactions and blocks of verified transactions, based on a standardized "gossip" protocol

>Messages, in the form of transactions, representing state transitions

>A set of consensus rules, governing what constitutes a transaction and what makes for a valid state transition

>A state machine that processes transactions according to the consensus rules

>A chain of cryptographically secured blocks that acts as a journal of all the verified and accepted state transitions

>A consensus algorithm that decentralizes control over the blockchain, by forcing participants to cooperate in the enforcement of the consensus rules

>A game-theoretically sound incentivization scheme (e.g., proof-of-work costs plus block rewards) to economically secure the state machine in an open environment

>One or more open source software implementations of the above ("clients")

## The Birth of Ethereum
This Chapter deep dives into how Vitalik Buterin the founder of Ethereum started working on extending the capabilities of Bitcoin and started sharind a whitepaper outlining the idea behind Ethereum as a general-purpose blockchain.
