# Chapter 1: What is Ethereum???

According to the Ethereum Yellow Paper, Ethereum is a project which attempts  to build the generalized technoocy; technolgy on which all transaction-based state machine concepts may be built. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's main goal is an ecosystem where developers can creatively build softwares via a template(smart contracts) using a peer-to-peer network integration.
All transactions are erified uisng sets of consensus rules/mechanisms. While Ethereum started as a Proof of Work(PoW) consensus protocol, it has been disocntinued for a more preferred protocol, Proof of Stake(PoS) following a hard fork. Whenever the word "Ethereum" is been mentioned, the closest attribute that comes to mind for most people, is blockchain. But blockchain goes a step deeper n describing Ethereum, as its an open, public and decentralized blockcbhain, unlike many others in the blockcahin space.
