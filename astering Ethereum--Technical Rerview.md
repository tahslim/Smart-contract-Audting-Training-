# Chapter 1: What is Ethereum???

According to the Ethereum Yellow Paper, Ethereum is a project which attempts  to build the generalized technoocy; technolgy on which all transaction-based state machine concepts may be built. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's main goal is an ecosystem where developers can creatively build softwares via a template(smart contracts) using a peer-to-peer network integration.
All transactions are erified uisng sets of consensus rules/mechanisms. While Ethereum started as a Proof of Work(PoW) consensus protocol, it has been disocntinued for a more preferred protocol, Proof of Stake(PoS) following a hard fork. Whenever the word "Ethereum" is been mentioned, the closest attribute that comes to mind for most people, is blockchain. But blockchain goes a step deeper n describing Ethereum, as its an open, public and decentralized blockcbhain, unlike many others in the blockcahin space.


# Chapter 2: Ethereum Basics

Ethereum creates a medium of accountability for several actions in the ecosystem, which we all know as ether. It is important to note that ether comes in sub-units with the smallest unit called "wei". Before one can transact on the Ethereum blockchain, you need a "trusted: wallet. Some popular examples are Metamask, Emerald wallet and Jaxx, to name a few. And though, Ethereum prides itself as an open blockchain, it also poses a risk as control becomes a huge responsibility on the part of the user/developer. These responsibilities include protecting one's private keys and never saving them digitally.
As stated earlier, transacions on the Ethereum blockchain requires a wallet or a contract. Wallets are also known as Externally Owned Accounts(EOA) while other accounts are known as contract accounts. One of the key differences between these two types of accounts, is thatEOAs can intitiate transactions while contract accounts can only "react" to transactions.
It is encourages to get a feel of what transactions look like, for beginners, using a test faucet. Due to the recent hard forks, the availabke test faucets are Goerli and Sepolia.
